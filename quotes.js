  {id: -5, text: "Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. \

  {id: -8, text: "Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. You don't become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and \

  {id: -11, text: "What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module, and it cost your company $10,000? The nonprofessional would shrug his shoulders, say \

  {id: -12, text: "Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. \
We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precisionâ€”so there will\
always be code.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},
  {id: -13, text: "When you are working on a problem, you sometimes get so close to it that you can't see all the options. You miss elegant solutions because the creative\
part of your mind is suppressed by the intensity of your focus. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to go home, eat dinner, watch TV, go to bed,\
and then wake up the next morning and take a shower.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},

  {id: -16, text: "Why do most developers fear to make continuous changes to their code? They are afraid they'll break it! Why are they afraid they'll break it? Because they \

  {id: -18, text: "There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a \
craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practicing.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},

  {id: -23, text: "The only way to prove that your software is easy to change is to make easy changes to it. And when you find that the changes aren't as easy as you thought, \
you refine the design so that the next change is easier. When do you make these easy changes? All the time! Every time you look at a module you make small, \
lightweight changes to it to improve its structure.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},
  {id: -24, text: "The problem isn't the simplicity of the code but the implicity of the code (to coin a phrase): the degree to which the context is not explicit in the code \
itself.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},
  {id: -25, text: "A system that is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the time is a testable system. That's an obvious statement, but an important \
one. Systems that aren't testable aren't verifiable. Arguably, a system that cannot be verified should never be deployed.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},
  {id: -26, text: "If the discipline of requirements specification has taught us anything, it is that well-specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as \

  {id: -28, text: "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is full of crisp \
abstractions and straightforward lines of control.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},
  {id: -29, text: "The problem is that we view estimates in different ways. Business likes to view estimates as commitments. Developers like to view estimates as guesses. \
The difference is profound.", author: {name: "Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)", page: "https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/"}},
