  {id: -3, source_: "The Clean Coder", text: "Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But professionals are expected to say no. Indeed, good managers crave someone who has the guts to say no. It's the only way you can really get anything done.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -4, text: "If you're good at the debugger it means you spent a lot of time debugging. I don't want you to be good at the debugger.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -5, source_: "Clean Code", text: "Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},

  {id: -11, source_: "The Clean Coder", text: "What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module, and it cost your company $10,000? The nonprofessional would shrug his shoulders, say \"stuff happens,\" and start writing the next module. The professional would write the company a check for $10,000!", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -12, source_: "Clean Code", text: "Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precisionâ€”so there will always be code.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -13, source_: "The Clean Coder", text: "When you are working on a problem, you sometimes get so close to it that you can't see all the options. You miss elegant solutions because the creative part of your mind is suppressed by the intensity of your focus. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to go home, eat dinner, watch TV, go to bed, and then wake up the next morning and take a shower.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},

  {id: -18, source_: "Clean Code", text: "There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work.

  {id: -22, source_: "Clean Code", text: "Programming is a social activity.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -23, source_: "The Clean Coder", text: "The only way to prove that your software is easy to change is to make easy changes to it. And when you find that the changes aren't as easy as you thought, you refine the design so that the next change is easier. When do you make these easy changes? All the time! Every time you look at a module you make small, lightweight changes to it to improve its structure.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -24, source_: "Clean Code", text: "The problem isn't the simplicity of the code but the implicity of the code (to coin a phrase): the degree to which the context is not explicit in the code itself.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -25, source_: "Clean Code", text: "A system that is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the time is a testable system. That's an obvious statement, but an important one. Systems that aren't testable aren't verifiable. Arguably, a system that cannot be verified should never be deployed.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -26, source_: "Clean Code", text: "If the discipline of requirements specification has taught us anything, it is that well-specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as executable tests of that code!", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -27, source_: "Clean Code", text: "Redundant comments are just places to collect lies and misinformation.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -28, source_: "Clean Code", text: "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -29, source_: "The Clean Coder", text: "The problem is that we view estimates in different ways. Business likes to view estimates as commitments. Developers like to view estimates as guesses. The difference is profound.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},
  {id: -30, source_: "Clean Code", text: "Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.", author_: "Uncle Bob"},

  {id: -54, source_: "Career Guide", text: "Cryptic comments are sometimes as bad, or worse, than cryptic code, because you can at least figure out what cryptic code does. You can't really figure out what a cryptic comment might have meant.", author_: "John Sonmez"},
